I moved to New York City in 2016 in search of a professional opportunity to leverage my education in cognitive science, my education in information science or my experience working with human children, specifically a role in an organization with a bold, progressive mission. I'm grateful to be in a position here that checks all of those boxes, analyzing children's mental health data in the MATTER Lab at the Child Mind Institute.
