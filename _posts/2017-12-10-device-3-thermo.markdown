description:  A generalization of the <a href="http://matter.childmind.org/tingle.html" target="_blank">Tingle</a>, the Thermo uses thermal sensors to detect its position relative to your body.  This novel approach to position tracking addresses the longstanding problem of “dead reckoning” and is the subject of a recent patent application.  <b>We are currently refining our latest prototype.</b>

The Thermo device could potentially find use in augmented or virtual reality systems, 
as it is lightweight and non-intrusive.  See the description of the 
[Tingle](http://matter.childmind.org/tingle.html) device,
which also serves to track position of the hand with respect to the head and torso,
but for a more narrow application (monitoring of body-focused repetitive behaviors).
