Until our own comprehensive questionnaire is ready (see <a href="http://localhost:4000/matter-website//m3q.html">M3Q</a>), we would like to know which questions in existing mental health questionnaires are most predictive of a psychiatric diagnosis.  The 10,000-participant [Healthy Brain Network](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/index.html) project already makes use of many mental health questionnaires, so we are using a variety of data-driven methods (machine learning, probabilistic programming systems, persistence homology) to find which of these questions are most informative. Once complete, we will make the software and results openly available.
