My work with the MATTER lab focuses on applying various forms of machine learning to the growing repository of psychiatric, phenotypic, and behavioral data collected by the Healthy Brain Network (as part of an ongoing study to collect data from 10,000 children). 

I also work within the Center for the Developing Brain to conduct exploratory data-driven analysis.
