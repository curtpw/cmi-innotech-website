## Background

I was named after my great grandfather Isaac Perry (his last name is my middle name). He owned a clock and watch repair shop in Elizabeth City, a town on the edge of the Great Dismal Swamp in North Carolina. During the 1930s Great Depression his shop was shuttered and he could find no work. One way he provided for his family was by repairing and reloading used, badly damaged shotgun and rifle casings which he traded to hunters in exchange for food. My father grew up in his workshop and I grew up in my father’s workshop. My mother graduated from medical school at 21, four years younger than most people in her class. She decided to become a psychiatrist because mental health issues plagued many people in her family. Her mother, my grandmother, later killed herself. I have worked in the mental health space the majority of my career and spent a great deal of my free time in various volunteer capacities as well. 

## Education

  - Almost entirely self taught.
