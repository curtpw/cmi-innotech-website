My primary involvement with the MATTER lab is to help build the M3Q.
As part of this project, I am creating an open source inventory of
current technologies related to mental health.

I am also the research operations coordinator in the Center for
the Developing Brain at the Child Mind Institute, where I support the development,
implementation and monitoring of research policies, protocols and procedures.

## Research Interests
I am pursuing a PhD on mental health disorders and collaborative
open science through the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI, Paris)
and its Open Collective Endeavours for an Autism Network (OCEAN), a project bridging
the gap between science, society and technology. My research interests include
empowering various stakeholders in the autism community to develop projects together
in a more open model of scientific inquiry. I founded the CRI outreach program in Chennai,
India, where students from different disciplines learn and apply innovative approaches in
research and education on projects associated with mental health disorders.
