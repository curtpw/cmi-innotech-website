I direct the MATTER lab's research and development of devices, apps, and informatics and analysis tools.
I am passionate about creating tools to help people and to help us better understand the human mind.
All the work that I do adheres to the principles of open science,
where researchers openly share data, code, resources and ideas.

## Previous mobile health work

Prior to joining the Child Mind Institute, I was the scientific lead on the
mPower Parkinson mobile health research study launched by Apple in partnership with Sage Bionetworks.
The mPower study is an example of how mobile devices can vastly scale up open medical research,
in this case by tracking symptoms of Parkinson disease from iPhone sensors in thousands of participants.
In the course of this work, I created an open source software pipeline for analyzing sensor data and
designed interactive visualizations to present results to patients, clinicians and researchers.

## Brain image analysis

I am the main developer of the open source [Mindboggle](http://mindboggle.info) software for
automated brain feature extraction, labeling and shape analysis.
Using the Mindboggle software, I helped to complete the largest brain shape
study ever conducted, and published some of the largest brain image analysis evaluation studies ever performed.
For this research program, I oversaw the construction of a new brain labeling protocol
and the worldâ€™s largest manually labeled set of brain images.
